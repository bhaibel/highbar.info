Hiring more diverse technical candidates does not require "lowering the bar."

## Installation & Development

Reasonably functional & up-to-date installs of Ruby/Bundler & Node/NPM are assumed.

After cloning the repository:

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
bundle
```

During local development, run:

```
gulp dev
```

This will autorebuild files as needed & run a dev server at `localhost:8080`.
