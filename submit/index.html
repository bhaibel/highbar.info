<h2>Add yourself!</h2>

<p>To add yourself to the project, please fork it on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/irregulargentlewomen/highbar.info">https://github.com/irregulargentlewomen/highbar.info</a>.</p>

<p>Please append your information to <code>data/people.json</code>. <code>&quot;name&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;bio&quot;</code> are required fields; target length for bios is about 400-600 characters. You may also optionally provide your <code>&quot;location&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;github&quot;</code> username, <code>&quot;twitter&quot;</code> username (no <code>@</code>, please!), <code>&quot;website&quot;</code> url, and/or <code>&quot;email&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>We ask that only people from groups that are historically underrepresented in the tech industry (women; people of color; LGBTQQIA people, including nonbinary people; people with disabilities; etc) add themselves to this project. We have neither the bandwidth nor the desire to police people&#39;s identities; if you add yourself, we&#39;ll assume you belong here.</p>

<p>We also ask that people only add <em>themselves</em>.</p>
